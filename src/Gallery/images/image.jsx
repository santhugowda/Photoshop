Right from the smallest of details to everything that was larger than life, Jay & Linda have been together through everything. Being a part of this wedding felt more like being with two friends who knew each other completely inside out are just now getting married to become roommates. One of the best times of the wedding has to be when their story was told in narrated. Jay & Linda's is a story of a cute Rom-com with its own sense of fun, wit, understanding, respect for each other and, most importantly, love like no other. At the end of a beautiful day in the Maldives, after having shot a wedding as beautiful and as intimate as theirs - all we could feel was a wholeness within and emotional warmth.

     To see them hold hands, and be in the moment every single day was nothing short of the magical sunset we witnessed in Bahrain. They are one of the those rarest couples that one could dream of to capture, witness pure love and just be present through their journey of finding each other.
     Dear, Ashish and Vaishnavi you both are Love.`,
